# given path for three directories  (lambda_dir, package_dir). write a python function that create a temporary directory (temp_dir) in the current directory. Create a python virtual environment and activate it and if a requirements.txt file is given it install library from the file into the activated virtual environment. copy all the contents into temp_dir and compress (zipup) it naming the compressed file package.zip and save the package.zip file inot package_dir. finally remove the virtual environment and temporary directory.
